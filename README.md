juju-nat
========

Expose Juju services running inside containers with NAT.

Deploying services into LXC and KVM containers is quite useful, but the whole point is exposing the service. This plugin sets up routing on the containing machine to do just that.

Also, a neat example of how to use the Juju APIs in golang.

Currently a work in progress.
