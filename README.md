juju-nat
========

Expose Juju services running inside containers with NAT.

Deploying services into LXC and KVM containers provides nice isolation and encapsulation. This plugin sets up routing on the containing machine to expose them.

Also, a neat example of how to use the Juju APIs in golang.

Currently a work in progress.
